# Federated event based attribute assurance and reasoning - OIX Alpha

An OIX Alpha project building on a [Whitepaper](https://openidentityexchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/191101-Building-a-Trusted-Environment-Whitepaper-FINAL.pdf) produced to document the findings of a Discovery project run through the summer of 2019.

This material is **under construction** by the core members and members of the Open Ecosystem Federation.  When considered alpha quality and ready for review artefacts will be placed in the [Ecosystem Toolkit Repository](https://github.com/open-ecosystem-federation/ecosystem-toolkit).
